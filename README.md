This is a basics todo_list

I use javascript, ejs,css  and sql for creating this

To use this things at first you have to create your own database in your localhost POSTGRESQL , once succesfully created you can you save todo-list even after disconnecting server for a while

After creating server you should start by "npm i"  to install the repositories
